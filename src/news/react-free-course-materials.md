- [A new project with create-react-app](https://drag13.io/react-learning-course-short/react-cra)

What is even more exiting, I've opened the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg-txtmOEQ8BniR8008O1mA) where I am giving talks based on this topics. Right now all talks are in Ukrainian (I am Ukrainian, you remember this, right?), but I have some plans about translations.

Hope to see you after the war ended.
