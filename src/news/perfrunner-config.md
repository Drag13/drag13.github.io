Hi all! Configuration file for the [Perfrunner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/perfrunner) already available in 0.9 version.

It supports:

- Tuning network conditions
- Multiple URL in a single test run

Create config file with `npx perfrunner init` command and use it running Perfrunner without arguments.

And you don't need hardcode long string in the package.json anymore ðŸ˜Ž!

If you have any question or spotted an issue - feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/Drag13/perfrunner)
