The good news just arrived (at least for me :)) Alpha version of the [Perfrunner](https://github.com/Drag13/perfrunner) already available via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/perfrunner). It is still fresh and lacks some nice features but it is fully functional and ready to work.

If you wondering what Perfrunner is - it's a simple automation tool to track the performance of the web application built on top of puppeteer. It tracks performance metrics, custom marks, amount of the resources, and much more. Feel free to try it with:

```cmd
npx perfrunner drag13.io
```

The code is not very nice and development still in progress, but I am on the way, so new features will arrive soon.
